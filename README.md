# 💤 SLEEP-DISORDER-DETECTOR

Welcome to the **Sleep Disorder Prediction** project! This project uses a machine learning model to predict sleep disorders based on user input.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/aero971/sleep-disorder-prediction.git
    cd sleep-disorder-prediction
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 🔧 Usage

1. **Run the Flask application**:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Open your web browser** and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. **Fill out the form** with your details and get your sleep disorder prediction along with helpful advice!

## 🧩 Model Details

The machine learning model used in this project is a trained classifier that predicts the likelihood of sleep disorders. The possible predictions are:
- **No sleep disorder**: Great! 👍 You are currently not showing signs of sleep disorder. 🌝
- **Sleep Apnea**: Oh no! 😕 You are showing signs of sleep apnea. 🧟
- **Insomnia**: Oh no! 😕 You are showing signs of insomnia. 🦉
